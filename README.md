# 📊 Demographic Decipher: Unveiling Insights with Machine Learning 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to **Demographic Decipher**, a journey through the intricate layers of the US Census data using the power of machine learning. This repository is a treasure trove of analysis, where sophisticated algorithms meet demographic data to uncover patterns, predict outcomes, and provide insights into the socioeconomic fabric of the United States.

## About the Project 📖

The US Census dataset, a rich source of demographic information, serves as the foundation for our exploration. **Demographic Decipher** employs various machine learning models to analyze this dataset, focusing on prediction tasks that range from income levels to employment status, using techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes classifiers.

## Datasets 📊

Our primary dataset is derived from the US Census, encapsulating a wide array of features from age and education to occupation and income. This data not only reflects the diversity of the American population but also provides a canvas for our algorithms to paint their predictions.
